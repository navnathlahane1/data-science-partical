1) Data Wrangling, I
Description:
In this project, I performed fundamental data wrangling tasks on an open-source dataset obtained from [source] (provide URL). Using Python and pandas, I imported libraries, loaded the dataset, and conducted data preprocessing, including handling missing values, checking data types, and normalizing variables.

2) Data Wrangling II
Description:
This project involves creating an "Academic Performance" dataset for students and executing various data wrangling operations in Python. I addressed missing values, inconsistencies, outliers in numeric variables, and applied data transformations to enhance understanding, creating a clean and well-structured dataset.

3) Descriptive Statistics - Measures of Central Tendency and Variability
Description:
Utilizing an open-source dataset, I computed summary statistics such as mean, median, minimum, maximum, and standard deviation for numeric variables grouped by a categorical variable. Additionally, I wrote a Python program to display statistical details for specific species in the Iris dataset, emphasizing basic statistical measures.

4) Data Analytics I
Description:
Developed a Linear Regression Model using Python/R to predict home prices based on the Boston Housing Dataset. Leveraging features of houses, the model aims to predict house prices, contributing to insights into the Boston housing market.

5) Data Analytics II
Description:
Implemented logistic regression using Python/R for classification on the Social_Network_Ads dataset. Computed a Confusion Matrix to evaluate model performance, calculating metrics such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and more.

6) Data Analytics III
Description:
Implemented a Simple Na√Øve Bayes classification algorithm using Python/R on the iris.csv dataset. Evaluated model performance with a Confusion Matrix, determining key metrics like Accuracy, Error rate, Precision, and Recall.

7) Text Analytics
Description:
Applied text analytics techniques on a sample document, including Tokenization, POS Tagging, stop words removal, Stemming, and Lemmatization. Created a representation of documents using Term Frequency and Inverse Document Frequency.

8) Data Visualization I
Description:
Used the Titanic dataset to explore patterns using Seaborn. Plotted a histogram to visualize the distribution of ticket prices for passengers, providing insights into the fare structure.

9) Data Visualization II
Description:
Visualized the distribution of ages with respect to each gender and survival status on the Titanic using a box plot. Drew observations and inferences from the statistical information.

10) Data Visualization III
Description:
Downloaded the Iris flower dataset, performed dataset scanning, and presented insights:

Listed down features and their types.
Created histograms and box plots for each feature, facilitating a comprehensive understanding of feature distributions and identification of outliers.
